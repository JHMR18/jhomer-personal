        <p>Hello, Coreen, Mahal, Bebe,</p>
        <p>
          Sana nagustuhan mo yung mga sinabi ni Jelly. Lahat ng sinabi nya ay totoo, mula sa puso ko. Alam kong walang "tayo" ngayon, pero para sa maikling sandaling ito, sana hayaan mo akong tawagin kang mahal ulit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahal, alam kong nagdesisyon tayong maging magkaibigan na lang, at oo, pumayag ako. But it's not working for me. Hindi ko kayang tingnan ka sa mata at sabihin na magkaibigan lang tayo, kasi sa mga mata mong 'yan, minsan kong nakita ang isang future, isang future kung saan magkasama tayong namumuhay, nagmamahalan, tinutupad ang mga pangarap natin, lumalaban sa buhay, at nagiging sandalan ng isa't isa. Gusto kong gawing realidad ang future na 'yon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sobrang sakit nung sinabi mong hindi mo na ako mahal. Parang gumuho ang mundo ko sa isang iglap. Alam kong may magagawa sana ako para maiwasan 'yon noong una pa lang, pero hinayaan ko lang. Wala akong ginawa, at 'yan ang bagay na pinakamatindi kong pinagsisisihan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ang tanga ko na hinayaan lang kitang mawala. Nawala ako sa sarili, nakalimutan ko ang pagmamahal ko sa'yo at ang mga pangako ko. Hindi ko alam kung paano ko nagawang balewalain ang lahat ng 'yon. Patawad, Mahal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kung mabigyan man tayo ng isa pang pagkakataon, ipinapangako kong hindi na mauulit 'yon. Gagawin ko ang lahat para alagaan at protektahan ang pagmamahalan natin. Natutunan ko na ang leksyon ko, at ngayon, mas alam ko na kung gaano ka kahalaga sa akin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noong nawala ka, hindi ako nakatulog. Hindi ka nawala sa isip ko kahit saglit. Gustong-gusto kong bumalik sa'yo, pero I wanted to be better first. Gusto ko maging mas mabuti dahil alam kong you deserve better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pero hindi ko akalain na marami ka nang makakausap na iba agad. Siguro, isa rin 'yan sa dahilan kung bakit parang ang bilis nawala ng pagmamahal mo sa akin. Sobrang sakit, Mahal. Hindi ko maipaliwanag kung gaano kahirap tanggapin 'yon—na ang taong pinakamamahal ko, parang unti-unti na akong nawawala sa puso niya.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hindi mo alam kung gaano ko pinagsisisihan na hinayaan kitang mawala. Kung pwede lang sana balikan ang nakaraan, pipiliin kong gawin ang lahat para manatili ka.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nang naglaro ulit tayo, sobrang saya ko na bumalik ka, pero hindi sa paraang inaasahan ko. Doon ko narealize kung gaano ako naging tanga at pabaya—iniwan kita, my bebe girl, ang Mahal ko, na alam kong mahal na mahal ko pa rin. Nung sinabi mong gusto mo na lang maging magkaibigan tayo, pumayag ako dahil ayokong mawala ka ulit. Alam kong sinabi kong hindi na kita mahal, pero alam mo namang kasinungalingan 'yon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahal, I never stopped loving you, Bebe. Siguro nabawasan, pero hindi nawala. Nananatili ka sa puso ko dahil alam ko, deep inside, it will always be you.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why I want to make things right between us. That’s why I spent Christmas time with you—to show you just how serious I am about us again. Every moment I spent with you reminded me of the love I’ve always had for you, and it made me realize even more how much I want you back in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are worth every effort, every chance, and every step I take to make things right. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But now after we spent Christmas together, my heart… omg may nanumbalik. I never thought I would love someone like this, ano ba kase ginawa mo saken HAHAHAHA grabe kana Mahal na mahal kita, Coreen, kahit anong mangyari, kahit ipagtulakan mo ako, kahit saktan mo ako, nandito pa rin ako, nagmamahal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I may not be able to give you everything you want, but I will give you everything I have. My whole heart, my time, and myself—everything I have, I will offer to you. Because of you, I’ve learned the true meaning of love.
        </p>
        <p>
          You told me there’s a lot of girls out there, and just find another girl. Yes, Bebe, there is a lot of girls out there, but there is not a lot of girls like you, my love. You are Coreen Kelly, the one and only on this earth. Baby, you are an amazing, beautiful woman, truly. You may not see it, but believe me when I say you are extraordinary in every way.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have this light that brightens the lives of the people around you, and you don’t even realize it. Your kindness, your laughter, and the way you care—it’s all so rare. You’re the kind of person who leaves an irreplaceable mark in someone’s heart, and for me, that mark is permanent. No one else could ever take your place.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why, no matter how many people I meet, no one will ever compare to you. You’re not just special—you’re my everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recently came across this quote: 'Every love story is beautiful, but ours is my favorite.' It instantly made me think of us, Mahal. Our story isn’t perfect—it’s filled with ups and downs, laughter and tears, mistakes and forgiveness. But despite everything, it’s the one I hold closest to my heart. It’s a story that has shaped me, taught me, and showed me the kind of love I never thought I’d have.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I think about our moments together, both the good and the bad, I realize just how much they mean to me. They’ve become memories that I cherish, lessons I’ve learned, and dreams I continue to hold on to. It’s a story I’m proud of because it’s ours—unique, special, and something I never want to let go of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahal, I want to keep writing this story with you. Page by page, chapter by chapter, creating new memories, overcoming challenges, and building a future together.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also came across another quote that struck a chord deep in my heart: 'You don’t just complete me; you make me better.' Mahal, this couldn’t be truer when it comes to you. You didn’t just fill a void in my life—you transformed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of you, I’ve learned what it means to truly love and to be loved in return. You’ve inspired me to grow, to change, and to strive to be the best version of myself. You’ve shown me my strengths, helped me see my flaws, and made me realize that I can be more—not just for myself, but for you and for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          With you, I feel like I’m capable of so much more. You push me to dream bigger, to work harder, and to love deeper. You’ve become my anchor and my motivation. I want to keep improving, not because you demand it, but because you deserve the very best of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahal, you don’t just complete me—you give my life meaning, purpose, and direction. And I can only hope to continue becoming someone worthy of the love and light you’ve brought into my world.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve said so many things today, and I know it may feel overwhelming, but there’s something I need to ask you. Through all the pain and mistakes, my feelings for you have never changed. In fact, they’ve only grown stronger. I want to be the man who stands by you, who loves you unconditionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, Mahal, will you give me another chance? Will you allow me to call you mine again? Will you be my girlfriend once more? I understand if you need time, but I just want you to know that I will always be here, loving you, hoping for a future where we can make everything right.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this message has been long, but I just needed you to understand where my heart stands. I don’t know what the future holds for us, but I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I will always cherish the love we shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide that we can’t be together again, I will respect that, and I’ll always carry you in my heart, no matter the distance. I just want what’s best for you, and if that means letting go, then I’ll learn to accept it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for everything, Mahal. I hope you find happiness, whether it’s with me or without me. I’ll always be grateful for the love you gave, and no matter where life takes us, I’ll always wish you nothing but the best.
